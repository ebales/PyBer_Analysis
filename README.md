# PyBer_Analysis
Bootcamp Week 5

## Background
The purpose of this analysis was to compare the weekly fares in three city types: urban, suburban, and rural.  The data analyzed covered from January 2019 through April 2019. 

## Results
A summary of the total rides, total drivers, and average fares of the three city types showed that urban cities use PyBer much more frequently than suburban or rural areas.  Urban cities also have the highest number of drivers and the lowest average fare.  These results can be seen in the table below:

Looking at the total weekly fare from January through April also demonstrated that urban areas generate the greatest amount of revenue.  It's interesting to note, that though the totals were different between the city types, each location followed the same general trends over this period of time. The similarity in trend may indicate that people in various city types use PyBer in the same way but that population densities may play a role in the frequency of use.

## Summary

In all, riders in urban centers are the primary users of PyBer and riders in rural areas are less likely to use this service.  The average fare per ride in a rural area is approximately $10 greater than the average fare per ride in an urban setting which may have some impact on the usage.  However, before making changes to fare calculations, it would be worthwile to assess the average distance in conjunction with average fare.  It's likely rides in urban settings are shorter distance rides, while rides in rural settings are longer distance rides.  Suburban rides may fall somewhere in between which aligns with the trends seen in this data.
